# Time-of-Flight-Spectroscopy-Data-Analysis

This a project under Dr. Arnab Khan (IISERB) to analyse the given data from a recoil ion momentum spectrometer, find the peak values from a Time of Flight vs counts graph, and process the data for calculating various properties, ie. Mass by Charge ratio, Kinetic Energy, Momentum.  Using Python NumPy, Matplotlib, Pandas, and SciPy libraries to plot and analyse the data.
