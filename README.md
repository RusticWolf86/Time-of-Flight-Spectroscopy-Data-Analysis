# Time-of-Flight-Spectroscopy-Data-Analysis

This project, conducted under the guidance of Dr Arnab Khan (IISERB), involves analyzing data obtained from a recoil ion momentum spectrometer. The main objectives include identifying peak values from a Time of Flight vs counts graph and processing the data to calculate essential properties, such as Mass by Charge ratio, Kinetic Energy, and Momentum. Python libraries such as NumPy, Matplotlib, Pandas, and SciPy are utilized for data plotting and analysis, enabling a comprehensive examination of the dataset. The project aims to gain valuable insights into the physical properties of the recoil ions and contribute to understanding ion-surface interactions.
